Time cannot be bent. We cannot create more time. We can only adjust the scope to fit the time allocated.

If you do not decide, someone else will.

See: Fixed time, variable scope. pg 16 `Shape Up` by Ryan Singer v1.7, 2019 edition

`Time` and `Scope` are the two axis we can use to pivot our project plan. I can set a bucket of time with hard edges to contin the scope, or, I can plan a clearly delimited project to contain the time it will take to full fill.

Human are incapaple of predicting. Specifically predicting how good they are at predicting. Se: `Black Swan` Nicolas Nassim Taleb

The further we are from the destination, estimations become a fantasy we lie ourselves with.

Making time because the project must be completed is a lie.

`Scope` is flexible but infinate.

`Time` is immutable.

Pick a standard bucket of time, e.g. `25min pomodoro` or `6 week bets`

This standard will train you to know what you can do in that time.

Decide which tasks will be completed in the allocated time.

When you run out of time.....`Stop work and put your pencil down`
`Cheers,
