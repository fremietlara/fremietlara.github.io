How important is the task you are performing? 

How valuable is your attention when it is focused on the task at hand?

How scarce is the time you can dedicate to this task?

`Single Purpose Devices` are tools, dedicated to a single task, regardless of their capacity to serve multiple purposes.

A book is single purpose device, but so can an iPad with one app installed to be used for reading.

If a task is deserving of your undivided attention, a dedicated device to perform the task is worth the expense and the physical space it will occupy in your life.

A `kit`, is a collection of devices with a single purpose, one activity.

There are practical consequences to this habit:

### One Context

Multipurpose devices require shifting context. This will delay and distract you from engaging with the activity.

Boot-up time is important when opening a text editor to capture a fleeting thought. Writing on a notepad and pen, is faster than unlocking your phone, and finding the app you need.

### Faster startup time. 
Starting a task is faster in two ways.

First, electronic devices will always be context ready faster when they are dedicated to a single task. When you contrast phone calls from a burner phone and an iPhone, this is self-evident.

Second, avoid wasting time searching for all the components necessary. Keeping single purpose devices together is a natural consequence of procuring devices that have only one purpose.

### Reliability

Single Purpose Devices are ready to use since last time, because no other activities have affected their integrity.

Poor signal will drain you phone battery, but it should be irrelevant to the task of capturing ideas with your voice recorder. 

Malfunctioning devices are easier to notice when they only perform one task. How many times have you tried using your laptop only to discover that an update is needed for the program you want to use.

### Tunnel vision / Zero distraction
Irrelevant notifications stealing your attention never happen.

### Habits are easier to form
Brain and Body is condition to the task.

The tools become the trigger to habit you scripted.

### Tools that you love are easier to find

Loving the tools you use improves habit formation. It will be a pleasure to jump into the task when you are attracted to the tools you use.

Single purpose devices, are always better than multipurpose counterparts because zero compromises are made. You will find it easier to pick the right tool when no other considerations are included.

## Ripple Effect

I have been unable to prove this wrong, and the paradigm has rippled everywhere in my life. 

Cheers,
