Three years ago, I had an urge to write. I am ecstatic  this finally came together.

I've been tinkering with many aspects of my life that I wanted to document and throw out into the world.

If I unload the mental conversations and create space for new ideas, I will consider this project a success.

Let's see how far this ripple goes.

I have tried to keep the tools stripped to bare minimum.

Emacs (cuz :cupid:), GitHub Pages (I use git daily) and Markdown (crept in from other projects I use)

the first post will be about [Stop work and put your pencil down]({% post_url 2020-03-01-stop-work-put-pencil-down %}) which recently rocked my world.

Thank you for letting me be part of your future cone of light.

Cheers,

Frem
