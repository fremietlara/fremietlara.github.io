References in your email are `Sidequests`. Move reference material out of your inbox.

## The Sidequest
A `sidequest` is a quest, that has no direct bearing on the main story/campaign of the video game.

Here's an example: After working for 40min on a task, I need to reference a PDF file that a co-worker sent me via email. I switch to my email app...Why is my water bill so high? 

Twenty minutes later, I remember I came to my inbox for a PDF file, but maybe its time for a bio-break... I was so close to completing my task.

Keeping references in your email is counter productive because of the cost of distractions in your of inbox. The cost of a distraction, outweighs the time you save searching in a pile of unprocessed entries.

Move out all reference material you may need later. If your eyes have seen the contents of an email, it should be piped out of your email account. 

## Evernote as an Email Bucket
`Evernote` has done a wonderful job as a recipient of emails containing reference material. PDF attachements are included in the note as an attachment. Zero suprises.

Once the reference is forwarded to `Evernote`, delete the original email from you email account. Every bit of information need, is now in Evernote. Any copies in your email are just data hoarding.

Cheers,

Frem
